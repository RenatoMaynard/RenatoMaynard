## üíª What You‚Äôll Find Here

In this space, I share my **academic projects**, **research models**, and **personal explorations** focused primarily on **Operations Research**, **Optimization**, and **Simulation**.  
I believe in **open knowledge** and aim to make my work accessible and useful to anyone interested in these areas.

Most of my Python codes are presented in Jupyter Notebook format, as I find it the best way to maintain clarity, structure, and readability.
